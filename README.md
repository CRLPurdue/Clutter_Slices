# Clutter_Slices
This repository contains code as well as the clutter slices dataset. 

Clutter Slices is a unique way to comprehend surroundings based on the distribution of objects in a space.

We present a novel dataset (Clutter_slices_data.zip) which contains 2D LIDAR scans of common spaces, such as Restrooms,
corridors, staircases, and shared spaces.

These scans are analyzed using simple machine learning methods to derive a unique signature of these spaces.

This unique signature is used for recognition and classification purposes. We attained 93.5% ccuracy with this approach in classifying
these spaces using the clutter Slices dataset.
